# Fortune Wheel: Negative

A Balatro mod that expands **The Wheel of Fortune** card by allowing it to roll
the **Negative** edition, which is normally excluded from its effect.
Includes two new Vouchers that unlock and enhance this new behavior.


## Installation

See the project's [README](https://github.com/LnxFCA/balatro-mods#installation) for installation instructions.


## Features

- Enables the **Negative** edition as a possible outcome when **The Wheel of Fortune** is used.
- Introduces two new Vouchers:
  - **Negative Spin**: Allows **The Wheel of Fortune** to apply the **Negative** edition to a random Joker.
  - **Fortune Inversion**: Doubles the chance of applying the **Negative** edition to a random Joker.
- Keeps existing edition chances (**Foil**, **Holographic**, **Polychrome**) untouched.
- Built using **smods**, improving compatibility with other mods.

## Usage

By default, **The Wheel of Fortune** has a 1-in-4 chance to apply a random edition
to a Joker, but only the following editions are normally considered:

- **Foil**
- **Holographic**
- **Polychrome**

With **Negative Spin**, the **Negative** edition is added to the eligible pool.
with **Fortune Inversion**, the chance of getting a Negative edition is doubled,
further improving your odds of applying it to a random Joker.

## Notes

- The **Negative** edition is a vanilla feature of Balatro, normally only seen through other sources like shop editions.

- **Negative** edition allows a Joker to not count toward the card slot limit, opening up powerful synergy combos.

- Perfect for players who enjoy crafting creative and efficient Joker builds.
