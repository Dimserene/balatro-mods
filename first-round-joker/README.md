# first-round-joker

This is a simple [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780) mod
that ensures a specific Joker card appears in the shop during the first round.

## Installation

See the project's [README](../README.md).

## Usage

> NOTE: While this mod provides similar functionality to `Choose First Shop Joker`,
> this mod is an independent work not related in any way to the former.

To activate the mod, you must hover over a valid Joker card and press the `F` key.
Once a valid Joker card is activated, the selected Joker will appear in the
first-round shop.

> NOTE: The Joker will have a "Negative" effect applied. You can disable it
> in the mod configuration menu.

After you purchase the Joker or click the `Next round` button, the game returns
to its normal behavior in subsequent rounds.

> NOTE: You can't use this mod on "undiscovered" Jokers. Using the activation
> process on an "undiscovered" Joker has no effect at all.

The activation process must be performed every time the game launches, unless
you activate the "Save selected Joker" option.

## Planned features

- Possibility of disabling the "Edition" effect applied.

- Instead of using a keyboard key, show a overlay menu where players can pick
they desired Joker.

- Improve integration with other mods as per users request.
