This is a simple [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780) mod
that ensures a specific Joker card appears in the shop during the first round.

## Installation

See the project's [README](../README.md).

## Usage

> this mod is an independent work not related in any way to the former.

To activate the mod, you must hover over a valid Joker card and the activation
key, by default `F`, you can change it on mod options.
Once a valid Joker card is activated, the selected Joker will appear in the
first-round shop.

The Joker will have a "Negative" effect applied. You can disable it
in the mod configuration menu (planned).

After you purchase the Joker or click the `Next round` button, the game returns
to its normal behavior in subsequent rounds.

> NOTE: You can't use this mod on "undiscovered" Jokers. Using the activation
> process on an "undiscovered" Joker has no effect at all.

The activation process must be performed every time the game launches, unless
you activate the "Save selected Joker" option.

Checkout the mod configuration menu to see all configuration options.
